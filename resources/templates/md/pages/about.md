Now I have Clojure.
I still complain, for not having discovered it earlier.

I'm Olivier, and I live and work near the sweet and sour city of Paris.

Java architect for over 20 years,
I completely switched to Clojure some years ago
for an ever increasing pleasure.

The purpose of this blog is to share some tips on this fabulous language,
with the side effect[^1] of working my written English.

If you want to get in touch with me
you can [email][1] me or find me on [GitHub][2].
